These are my dotfiles and configurations for some of the programs I use.
In general the configurations are optimized for a system running macOS, with iTerm2, neovim, git and Homebrew.

# Install

The files are managed by [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so basically:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/anderkonzen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Setup `stow`: 

```shell
cd .dotfiles
stow -t ~ stow
```

The stow directory should be the first one so the stow configuration is installed properly (global ignore files, etc).

3. Install the desired package with `stow <dir>`

# Conventions

Directories starting with a `_` are not supposed to be *stowed*.

# Requirements

Prior to symlink the directories, I recommend installing all the apps declared in the `_homebrew/Brewfile`:

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles/_homebrew
brew bundle
```

this will install `stow` and other necessary apps. Of course, you need [`brew`](https://brew.sh) installed to run this command.

## Linux

### Configuring the shell

Install fzf
1. Install zsh
2. Install [`zplug`](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)
3. Rename your .zshrc to something else if you want a backup, then execute `stow zsh`.
Restart the shell so zplug installs the plugins.
4. base16: git submodule update --init --recursive then stow base16



# Configuring other apps

## git

Use `~/.gitconfig.local` to store sensitive data like git credentials and other local configurations. For instance:

```shell
[user]
    name = Anderson Konzen
    email = anderkonzen@example.com
```

## neovim

### deoplete.vim

I am using [deoplete.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) to have omni auto-completion for a few languages (ruby, elixir and javascript).
In order to have it this working, you need to have *python3* and *node.js* installed (these are installed as part of the `brew bundle` above).

Before installing the plugin in neovim, you also need to install the neovim-python module with:

```sh
pip3 install --user neovim
```

Then, in neovim, execute `:PlugInstall` and then `:UpdateRemotePlugins`.
You can check if everything is working fine with `:CheckHealth`.
